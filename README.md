<b>Note:</b>
After installation, the addon is initally paused and does nothing, so one can
modify the preferences to their requirements, without having to worry about
losing any tabs. Afterwards the addon can be activated/deactivated by
clicking on the toolbar button. 

<b>Usage:</b>
<ol>
  <li>change the preferences to your requirements</li>
  <li>
    click the toolbar button to start/stop auto closing
  </li>
</ol>
